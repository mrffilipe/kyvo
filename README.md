# Kyvo

[English](./README.md) | [Português](./README.pt-BR.md)

> **Pronunciation:** *Kyvo* is pronounced like **"Key"vo** — rhymes with English *key* plus *vo*.

An **identity and access platform (IdP)** for an ecosystem of applications: centralizes local authentication, issues JWT tokens via OIDC, organizes tenants (organizations), members, roles, OAuth applications, and supports federation with external providers (Firebase, Cognito, etc.).

Inspired by Keycloak-style platforms: a managed, multi-tenant IdP with its own admin console.

## Getting started

| Path | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Development** | Clone the repo and follow [GETTING_STARTED.md](./GETTING_STARTED.md) sections **1–6** (source, local PostgreSQL/Redis) |
| **Production** | Deploy the `kyvo` monolith image — [GETTING_STARTED.md § Production](./GETTING_STARTED.md#7-production-deployment-docker-compose) (single service, unified `.env`) |
| **Maintainers** | Build and push images — [docs/DOCKER_PUBLISH.md](./docs/DOCKER_PUBLISH.md) |

## Product overview

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Local IdP** | Email + password authentication stored with BCrypt. Configured at bootstrap. |
| **OIDC** | Authorization code + PKCE flow. RS256 tokens. Discovery at `/.well-known/openid-configuration`. |
| **Multi-tenant** | Users belong to multiple tenants with independent roles. |
| **Platform admin** | Users with `prole=plat_admin` manage tenants, applications, and global IdPs. |
| **OAuth applications** | Registry of consumer apps with public (PKCE) or confidential clients. |
| **Identity Providers** | Extensible federation: Local (default), Firebase, Cognito, Generic. Each declares `IdpCapability` flags (LocalPassword, GoogleSocial, etc.) with hard-lock for email/password and conflict warnings for socials. |
| **Self-registration** | Central `/account/register` page on the IdP with configurable password policy and rate limiting. Consumer apps redirect to OIDC; they never expose private signup endpoints. |
| **Modern login UI** | Login and register pages are served by Blazor Web App Static SSR (no MVC views). Google sign-in uses Firebase `signInWithPopup`, then `POST /account/external-signin` to continue the OAuth `returnUrl`. |
| **Secret protection** | IdP credentials (Firebase ServiceAccount, WebApiKey) are encrypted at rest via ASP.NET Core Data Protection. |
| **Audit logs** | Event tracking per tenant. |
